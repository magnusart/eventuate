 * Supports the reliable delivery of messages to destinations by enabling applications
 * to redeliver messages until they are confirmed by their destinations. Both, message
 * delivery and confirmation must be executed within an [[EventsourcedActor]]'s event handler.
 * New messages are delivered by calling `deliver`. When the destination replies with a confirmation
 * message, the [[EventsourcedActor]] must generate an event for which the handler calls `confirm`.
 * Until confirmation, delivered messages are tracked as ''unconfirmed'' messages. Unconfirmed
 * messages can be redelivered by calling `redeliverUnconfirmed`. This is usually done within a
 * command handler by processing scheduler messages. Redelivery occurs automatically when the
 * [[EventsourcedActor]] successfully recovered after initial start or a re-start.
